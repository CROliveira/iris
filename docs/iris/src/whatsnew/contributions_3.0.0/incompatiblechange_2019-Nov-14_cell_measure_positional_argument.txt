* A :class:`iris.coords.CellMeasure` requires a string ``measure`` attribute to be defined, which can only have a value
  of ``area`` or ``volume``. Previously, the ``measure`` was provided as a keyword argument to
  :class:`~iris.coords.CellMeasure` with an default value of ``None``, which caused a ``TypeError`` when no
  ``measure`` was provided. A ``measure`` is now a positional argument of :class:`~iris.coords.CellMeasure` and must
  be specified on instantiation.
